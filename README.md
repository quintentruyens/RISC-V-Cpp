# RISC-V-Cpp
A C++ emulation of a RISC-V computer. Intended to be identical in functionality to the original [Logisim version](https://github.com/quintentruyens/RISC-V-logisim) of the processor.

The implementation is in Visual Studio and the visualisation uses the outdated [olcConsoleGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/olcConsoleGameEngine.h) by OneLoneCoder because it performed better than the newer [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) for the mostly text-based visualisation. Unfortunately, this means it will only run on Windows.

This is a personal project which is missing documentation, instructions and proper testing.
